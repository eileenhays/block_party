https://blockparty-app.herokuapp.com/

Conceived and built by Eileen Hays-Schwantes

## Overview
BlockParty is a web app that provides users a way to buildup the community around them. 
It's for people who want to engage with neighbors that share similar interests, such as 
hiking, playing boardgames, discussing books, and coding. By entering their "homebase," 
the user can search for upcoming public activities and events within their vicinity using 
Meetup and Eventbrite APIs. Event details, including name, time, description,  and link 
can be easily viewed geographically on a Google map or by date on a list. Users can login 
to save and view their favorite events, which is updated when events expire.
