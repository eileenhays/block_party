Project Description and Goals: 
A web app will enables users to engage with their community through real social interaction with their neighbors. The user will be able to input an address and will interactively showcase dynamic events in their neighborhood on a map. 
  
User stories: 
* [x] I can input an address into Google Maps and it will show a marker. 
* [x] I will be able to see upcoming local events with a marker on Google Maps. 
* [x] I will be able to see more information about an event by clicking on a marker. 
* [x] I can search for other addresses.
* [x] I can register and login to my profile page. 
* [x] I can save my address on my profile for later use. 
* [x] I can favorite an event on my profile for later viewing. 
2.0 
* I can add an event to my calendar. 
* I can change the radius of my search from .5 mi up to 5 mi.
* I can search for events for a specific time period in the future. 
* I won’t see old or expired events in favorites. 
* I can create my own events. 
* I can see a data analysis on the events queried. 
* I will be able to invite my neighbors.
* I can see recommendations of events to attend.  
* I can see more information about my community.

Tech and Stack: 
  Backend: 
* Python, Flask, Jinja, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
* Libraries: passlib (encryption & verification), datetime, pytz, flask-login
* Machine learning?? or predictive algorithm? maybe just add some data visualizations (chart.js)??

  Frontend: 
* JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX
* HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap (HTML/CSS/JS framework),

  APIs: 
* Google Maps Javascript API
* Meetup 
* Eventbrite? 
* Facebook events? https://github.com/tobilg/facebook-events-by-location
* FunCheapSF API?
* Volunteer Match?

Additional Data: 
* Parks: community gardens (SF Open Data)
